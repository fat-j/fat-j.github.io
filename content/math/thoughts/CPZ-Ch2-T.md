### Initial Thoughts
These people copied Computer Science!!!!!!
Actually heck CS people they suck

### During Thoughts
I think anybody with some basic programming knowledge would be able to pick this up.

I also don't really know how this relates to proofs because I don't think there would be any need to know the truth tables of any complex statements because I would assume people would breakdown complex statements into ones where you can easily determine the truth value, because how would you even be able to understand a proof if you need to constantly do all this useless mental calculation. 

### Afterthoughts
Nice integration with set theory, because I feel like it might've taken way too long to explain some of these things in depth without knowing sets and their symbols. 

I feel like some of the wordier things like the truth table explanations could be removed or compacted since I think they are pretty intuitive and I don't think anyone who could understand Chapter 1 wouldn't understand what's happening in Chapter 2.
