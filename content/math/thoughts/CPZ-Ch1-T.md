Working on the CPZ Mathematical Proofs book

### Initial Thoughts
I've read through Chapter 0 so far. The introduction to mathematical writing is really nice and the book seems pretty concise right now, but does become a bit too idea dense and I need to reread sometimes. There's exactly 0 useless info so that's great. Probably one of the best textbooks I've read so far (but I haven't read many).

### Afterthoughts on Ch.1 (Set Theory)
I love the A = {x:p(x)} notation since it was always hard to explain conditional sets before I knew this. 

Would a heterogeneous set be able to do anything with other nonsimilar heterogeneous sets. 

I think they should be teaching this over matrices in Precalc instead of matrices or maybe even earlier. Idk what the point of putting matrices in Precalc is because we don't even learn that much logic from it and it just feels abstract to be abstract when it's at such a surface level. I do think that everybody should learn this though, so maybe it should be somewhere after Algebra 1.

Power sets are also great. It seems really convenient in stats and a lot of "game-ier" things such.

Indexed collections just feel annoying to be annoying, but I do see how it would be really compact once you're familiar with them. I can also see some nice logic being done with them. 

Learning partitions or something similar should also be a basic requirement for graduation from HS.
