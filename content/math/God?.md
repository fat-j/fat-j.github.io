### Introduction
Apparently there's this common opinion that logically god cannot exist for some reason because he couldn't create himself or something like that. I don't believe in the Christian/Muslim or any equivalent God, but I do think that a "god" or afterlife has to exist in some form. 

### Assumptions
I assume these things are true:
1. Time is infinite
2. lim x->âˆž of c/x = 0
3. Consciousness is a thing and not an effect of atoms working together to create an "illusion" of consciousness
4. Time is experienced at a constant rate
5. If there isn't something, there is nothing

**For point 1**: From what I understand currently, one of the theories is a heat death of the universe, which would means entropy is extremely low, and we experience time as the loss of entropy. When entropy is nearly 0 "we" wouldn't be able to tell the difference from going backward and forward in time because everything would happen seemingly randomly.

I'm assuming that time is what people would conventionally view as time, and that even when things act randomly, it's still possible to know the reverse of this process if every possible variable is known. 

**For point 2**: I'm assuming the universe can be perfectly described using math.

**For point 3**: This would mean that something akin to a "soul" would exist. I'm not saying that it's something spiritual because this would automatically be invalid from the "logical" perspective, but I mean that being consciousness is measurable AND that a purely algorithmic entity cannot be conscious

**For point 4**: If time isn't experienced at a constant rate, that would mean point 2 is invalid because the equation for <percieved time>/<all possible time> would be some form of x^a/x^b, meaning that the limit could also be infinity or a constant. 

**For point 5**: Self explanatory

### Reasoning
If all of my current assumptions are true, this would mean that moment I'm currently experiencing at this exact time is finite. It would also mean that the time I experience is finite, and is able to be described by a positive number c. 

If I assume that we experience "nothing" before and after we die, this would mean that there is an infinite duration of "nothing", but there is a finite amount of "living". This "living" would account for 0.000...1% of the possible states I could be in. I understand that it is mathematically possible for a process with a probability of 0 to happen, but I believe that "living" within this exact moment shouldn't be possible if life is finite because there should be so much "nothing" that the experience of being in this lifetime should pass in an instant.

If these assumptions are true, the only possible reason why consciousness would be able to be experienced is because our consciousness lasts an infinite amount of time. This would mean that either there is an infinite afterlife, or that there is a Creator and that it would be able to create something that can have "something" without the concept of nothing also being a thing. This would be similar to how light is a "thing" because it is what happens when there is no darkness.

Of course, even though I said that there was something akin to a "god" or afterlife, this doesn't mean it would be a good thing. The experience of time could potentially slow down as we die until it becomes so slow that the exact moment of death becomes an infinite duration. I feel like this would be even worse than there being nothing, so I do hope that there's either God or nothing. (Another possibility I considered is that life might be experienced as a repeat of the exact same actions with an illusion of choice, but I haven't thought about it that much.)

Currently with my understanding of the universe, the only possibility I can think of that would mean there is no "god"/afterlife is something I heard about the formation of the universe. During the heat death there would be a kind of random "stew" and that there would be a mathematical possibility of atoms moving in the perfect way in which a chain reaction akin to the Big Bang would happen. If there is a soul that is transferred across lifetimes then that would also mean that existence would also be infinite if time is. I assume this would mean that we would be able to exist in this exact moment even when there is an infinite duration of "nothing".

### Added Later
I do see a hole in my logic where if there is nothing, then the only state we can perceive is the state of something, meaning its guaranteed that we would have consciousness. I think this would mean that the only thing left is finding the answer of how that something got created, because if we were to exist, we would have to exist in the universe that has something and not nothing.
