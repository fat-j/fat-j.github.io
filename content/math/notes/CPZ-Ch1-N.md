### Set Theory
Anything can go into a set.
Lowercase is used for items in a set (eg. {a, b, c})
Uppercase is used for sets (eg. A, B, C)

Sets will be denoted in the form A, B, C ...
Items in a set will be denoted in the form x, y, z

### 1.1
A = {x: p(x)} means for all x which fulfill the condition of p(x), x∈A (eg. A = {x: |2|} = {2, -2})
|A| is the **cardinality** of A, which is the number of items in set A

### 1.3
A **universal set** is a set which encompasses all the subsets we are interested in studying. (eg. R is  the universal set of Z because all integers are rational numbers)
A **proper subset** is a set where A⊆B, but A≄B
A **power set** P consists of all subsets of a set (eg. P(A) has every possible set∈A, including ∅)

### 1.4
An **intersection** (denoted by ∩) is the set containing the elements belonging in both A and B (eg. Q∩I = ∅)
If two sets contain no elements of the other they are **disjoint**. 
A∪B (a **union** between A and B), contains all the elements in either A or B
A-B (the **difference** between A and B), contains all the elements contained in A and not B (also known as the **relative complement**).
For a universal set U, the **complement** of A (denoted by A̅) is the set of of elements not contained in A, but contained in U. 

### 1.5
The **union of multiple sets** A1,A2,A3... is defined by i=1nAi
The **intersection of multiple sets** A1,A2,A3... is defined by i=1nAi
The **index set** is a set for which every a∈I has a set Sa

### 1.6
A **partition** of set A is a collection of multiple subsets of A, which will be named Sn. The union of every set S is A. If there is are two sets, X and Y, and if X, Y ∈ A, then X∩Y=∅.

### 1.7 
The **cartesian product** (also known as product) of a set A x B matches the coordinates based on the order of multiplication. For example B x A will create a set containing ordered pairs (x, y) in which every element inside of B is an x and every element in A is a y. Every element in A or B will pair with every element in B or A, respectively. 

### Definitions:
∅ = {}, also known as the null set

R contains all the reals

Z contains all the integers

N contains all the natural numbers

C contains all the complex numbers

Q contains all the rationals

I contains all the irrationals
