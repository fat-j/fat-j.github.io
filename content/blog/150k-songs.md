### Setup
I'm using quodlibet since its the only gui one I know that can handle this many songs and it's just off a hdd. There's 150254 songs, 1 year 83 days long, and some amount <772 GiBs. It's mostly Touhou and J-core stuff with some classical mixed in.
Listening to albums in alphabetical order.

I also lost my previous records somehow so November 2nd 2023 is the new start.

### 11/2/23

Still in the albums which start with a number, ones I know are Holmgang ov Gensokyo, Lost Frog Productions, Yuuhei Satellite, Amateras Records and a bunch of J-core dudes. 

Also found another Nostalgic Blood of the East arrangement, "琴音 - 槐" by 38BEETS which will always instantly go into the top songs playlist. 

As I was listening to "シイナフユキ - 星の見た夢 ～ elegiac verse" by シイナフユキ I got some random inspiration to write the best English essays I've ever written and an amazing personal statement for college so that's going in top.

I'm not sure where I discovered Lost Frog Productions from, but if it's from here its the only good producers I've heard so far that I didn't know about beforehand.
