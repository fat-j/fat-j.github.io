I have trouble navigating modern technology. I remember just a few weeks ago, I got the maddest I've ever gotten at technology. It wasn't some kind crazy complicated Linux thing, some n-dimensional-hypersphere-ai-generated-buzzword1-buzzword2 coding thing, but a washing machine with a touchscreen. 

To me, trying to figure out how to use this washing machine was one of the most complicated things I've ever done. Sometimes when I pressed a button it would do nothing, if I held it would still do nothing, but if I quickly tapped it, the thing happened. This thing was just so unpredictable that it took like 3 minutes to figure out how to turn it off. When I pressed the power button it would turn off like 3 seconds later but I didn't know that so I pressed it again, turning it on. 

I hate using iOS because I feel like its always so unpredictable and unexplicit in what it will do next. I don't remember much, but the settings are designed like a maze instead of treating it like a bunch of folders, there were no descriptions of the settings, I had no idea where to find certain things because there was no text that the "normies" might find scary.

I feel like using Linux or other less abstract things is so much easier for me because you always know what's going to happen. If you mess something up, there's always the logs, but everything is done is a progressive way so you can build to something step by step. Everything is clearly documented so you always exactly what something is. 

I don't think I'm some kind of tech genius for easily picking up Linux type things, but I think that most people just ignore the details. When there's install guides, the instructions clearly outline each step, but yet it's somehow too hard to read. I clearly know how each thing in Linux will work so when I do trial and error, I never need to predict the way that something will act. I only need to keep doing it until the thing I want to do happens.
